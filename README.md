# demobot-tank
## code for our demobot and code ideas for future robots.
### Unconventional things we've done
1. using an xbox controller instead of the usual 
2. being able to switch between field oriented control and normal control
3. have a stinking lot of autonomous, with more on the way.
### to do list
- [ ] write autonomous script to compete
- [ ] make autonomous code run based off of encoder, not a timer
- [x] add turbo button
- [x] add selector to switch between robot oriented and field oriented.
- [ ] add code to control lifter
- [ ] something else(i forgot what it was)
